[UltiGameMate](https://fpl.ultigamemate.com/) (or UGM for short) is a fantasy football game where you pick games instead of players and get points for the best part of every game - goals, saves, drama, and more.

## Why did I build this game?

I've been playing Fantasy Premier League for a long time, but I stopped around three years ago.

I was annoyed that I wasn't rooting for my favorite team, but for my fantasy players instead. When my favorite team loses, and it's crushed by my fantasy player, it's fine. But that shouldn't be fine. A true fan should always support their team.

So I came up with the fantasy football game that allows you to watch any game without emotional conflict.

## What is UltiGameMate?

UltiGameMate is a fantasy football game where you predict which Premier League matches will be the most exciting.

You get points for goals, comebacks, red cards, and all the drama that makes football the best game in the world.

It's like betting on games, but it's free, and it shows your skills for predicting great matches.

It takes a few minutes to pick your games, add boosts, and then just enjoy the games.

You can play it with your friends or colleagues in a private league, or you can just see how well you do globally.

## Early stages

I plan to add more leagues in the future and more stats that will affect the final game score.

Since the game has just launched, I'm open to any suggestions or feedback.

Share the game with your friends!
