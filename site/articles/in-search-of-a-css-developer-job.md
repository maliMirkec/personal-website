There was some disturbance in my company the last few days, making me worry about my job. Luckily, it was a false alarm, but I spent a whole day exploring the options.

Usually, I find jobs via freelancing platforms or the job finds me, but this time I wanted to try my luck and find it myself.

My requirements are simple:

-   I want to work primarily with CSS,
-   I want to work remotely, and
-   I want a full-time position.

## Twitter

As a first step, I tweeted that I was searching for a job. Some considerate people retweeted it, and I got some initial contacts, which made me happy. Yet, I wonder if I would have gotten more contacts if I had more followers. Probably yes, but we will never know because I have had around 980 followers for the past few years. Thanks, Twitter algorithm.

If you think it will help, feel free to retweet [my tweet](https://twitter.com/malimirkeccita/status/1564583796762189826).

I also tried to use Twitter search, but I didn't find anything useful.

## Search engines

After Twitter, I wanted to try my luck on search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo. The first search term I tried was "css developer job remote." The first two pages were full of job searching sites. Some of these sites, like Turing and Toptal, are freelancing platforms. You must go through the vetting process to be accepted to the network to apply for a job. Although I am a member of some of these platforms, I didn't want to use them since I tried to cut the middle man.

Fun fact: if you search for "css developer," you might find my Toptal article about CSS roles as a top result.

Other results included sites like We Work Remotely, Arc, Jooble, SimplyHired, etc. Job postings on almost all of these sites had one of the following problems if not all of them:

-   not a CSS developer job,
-   outdated job postings,
-   not a remote position, or
-   salary is too low.

When arriving at these sites, you're thinking: "Wow, there are a lot of CSS jobs." But when taking a closer look, you realize that most listings are not CSS jobs. Instead, most of them are React, Vue, or other forms of full-stack or front-end positions.

Some sites, like Arc, show job postings from a few months ago or last year. I mean, these sure cannot still be open now.

What I find most annoying are so-called "remote" positions. First, if I have to report to some office, this job is not remote. Also, if I search for a remote position, I mean a worldwide position, not a remote US position. Finally, it is frustrating to read the full job description and realize it is only for US citizens.

When I found a job posting that seemed like a good fit, the salary was too low. The other problem is that there is no salary info at all. I generally feel like CSS developer jobs are underpaid.

I have tried the other search terms, like "ui developer job remote" and "html developer job remote," but I had a similar experience.

In general, there are too many job postings. I am not sure how other people find a job via search engines, but to me, it seems impossible.

## LinkedIn

The following location in my quest was a LinkedIn job search. It is no different than the rest of the sites --- it had the same problems. The only difference is that I saw a lot of job postings from countries like Poland, Ireland, and Norway, which I liked.

## Job boards

I remembered that I had bookmarked some job boards back in the day. Unfortunately, I discovered some are no longer working, like CSS-Tricks's job board, Codepen's job board, and [Stack Overflow's job board](https://goodbyestackoverflowjobs.com/). Others, like Smashing Magazine's job board, are pretty outdated.

I also searched [the HackerNews "Who is hiring?" thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32306920). It was full of exciting companies, but there were no CSS developer postings.

## Companies

While looking for Stack Overflow's job board, I discovered [the Companies section](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies), but like the HackerNews thread, I didn't find a CSS developer job. I also discovered Arc's companies page and other great lists of outstanding companies, but I couldn't find CSS developer jobs.

I also searched other prominent companies, like Netlify, GitHub, Airbnb, etc., to see if they were hiring CSS developers. Unfortunately, I didn't find a single CSS developer position.

## Conclusion

After spending the whole day trying to find a CSS developer job, I wonder if there is one. It might be that my searching skills are not good enough or that I was looking at the wrong places. On the other hand, it might be that these jobs are not something to be advertised. I don't know, but it made me quite frustrated.

Generally, one could easily get lost in a sea of job posting sites and job postings. That is why I decided to write this post. The main goal of this article is to find me a perfect employer. So, feel free to contact me.
