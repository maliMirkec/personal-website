We should automate our development process whenever possible. But there are so many tools available and new ones are published every week. Even though these tools help us, it could be very time consuming to learn and to handle all of these tools.

In this post I'll show you how to automate development process using only Atom packages.

## Manual tasks

Let's say we're starting a new project. It's an open source project, a `JavaScript` plugin, which anyone could contribute. Developers who wants to contribute need source code, beautiful and easy to read. Developers who just want to use the plugin need minified and compressed files.

### Beautiful source code

Beautiful source code is a must. Nobody wants to work on a code that is not properly aligned or formatted. But not every developer could produce beautiful code. Most of the times this is not intentional, because when we are in a process of development, we're not focused on beautiful code, we're focused on functional code.

To make our source code beautiful, we could go manually through every line and apply proper formatting and alignment. We are not gonna do this, though, because there are online tools which could help us, like [Online JavaScript beautifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/).

But that doesn't feel right, too. Who has the time to copy-paste code back and forth.

### editorconfig

We should use **[editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/)**, a set of rules which define how our code should be formatted. These rules should be written in `.editorconfig` file which should be placed in a root folder of our project. **editorconfig** provides plugins for almost every popular text editor. That's awesome, because our plugin will be beautiful no matter who works on it. Yaay!

_**editorconfig** rules are out of scope of this article. For full documentation, refer to [**editorconfig** official page](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties)._

What about `CSS` files?

Sure, we should use **editorconfig** here, too. But what if we want to sort `CSS` properties, for example? Or add missing semicolons? Easy, we could use **csscomb**.

### CSScomb

[**csscomb**](https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb)is a tool which formats `CSS`
files based on configuration file `.csscomb`. There was an online
tool, but just like Online JavaScript beautifer, there
is unnecessary cope-paste back and forth again.

To create our config file, we could refer to [all available options](https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js/blob/dev/doc/options.md) or to online config builder. We should put our config file in a root folder of a project.

This won't work unless we install Atom package for **csscomb**. There are several packages available, but my favorite is [atom-css-comb](https://atom.io/packages/atom-css-comb).

Now our `CSS` files are beautiful, too.

### pretty-json

We should publish our plugin on package manager, like [bower](https://bower.io/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). That means we should create and configure `JSON` files: [`bower.json`](https://bower.io/docs/creating-packages/) and [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json). `JSON` files should be pretty, too. That's where [**pretty-json**](https://atom.io/packages/pretty-json) package steps in.

This very popular plugin formats `JSON` files on command. As a bonus, this plugin could warn us if our `JSON` files are not properly formatted.

### Minification and uglification

Our source code is beautiful, now's the time to compress our files. Compressed files are usually used in production. Final user doesn't need beautiful file, user doesn't even care about the file, user just want a super fast and fluid experience. Every byte matters, because smaller files equals faster load.

`CSS` files are minified and `JS` files are uglified. We don't want to use online tools, like [JavaScript Compression Tool](https://jscompress.com/) or [CSS Minifier](https://cssminifier.com/). We don't want to use Atom packages either. The main reason is because we want to make a separate file that is compressed and that couldn't be achieved easily inside Atom.

What we want is a tool which creates compressed versions of our source code files in a separate files automatically. And for that task we should use tools like **[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)**. **Gulp** is a task runner based on [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/). **Gulp** community created and shared quite a large number of plugins. For our tasks to compress our files, let's use [gulp-cssmin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cssmin) and [gulp-uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify).

_**Gulp** tasks are out of scope of this article, please refer to official [**Gulp** documentation](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)._

After we installed **Gulp** and defined **Gulp** tasks, we should run it from console by typing "gulp" and the name of our task. For example, `gulp cssmin`. When **Gulp** finishes with a task, our `CSS` file should be compressed. The same is with `JS` files, run `gulp uglify` inside console.

Although this is very easy, it is also a little bit clumsy, switching from Atom to console all the time. Fortunately, we could run these tasks from Atom using **gulp-manager**.

### gulp-manager

[**gulp-manager**](https://atom.io/packages/gulp-manager) is a package that could run **Gulp** tasks from Atom. This package doesn't work without [bottom-dock](https://atom.io/packages/bottom-dock), therefore we should install this package, too. After installation, we should run it through default keybinding for **gulp-manager**: `alt-shift-D`.

We should see a new dock with 3 main sections:

* task list,
* input field and
* console output.

If we want to run a task, we could click it from task list. On the right side we could see a console output for these task. It is very useful when debugging invalid or failed task. Alternatively, we could write the name of the task inside input field and then press _Enter_.

{% cldnry "gulp-manager-in-action_np6g5y" "Gulp manager in action." %}

Our files are now compressed and tasks are run from Atom. We don't need a console anymore.

## Conclusion

Most of this tools are available as a standalone solutions. But why use them separately, when we could run them from inside Atom editor.

Once when you get comfortable with this kind of automation, you won't think of manual tasks again.
