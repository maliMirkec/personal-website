I wrote about [my favorite Chrome extensions for web development](/articles/my-favorite-chrome-extensions-for-web-development-mostly/) four years ago. This time I wanted to share a few of my favorites that I discovered since then (that may or may not be related to web development).

## Grammarly to Markdown

Before discovering the [Grammarly to Markdown](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-to-markdown/bjodbpcjeogaihbekannledankhcjbgo) extension, I used [the Paste to Markdown](https://euangoddard.github.io/clipboard2markdown/) online tool. That implied I had to copy the text from Grammarly, paste it into Paste to Markdown, copy it again, and then paste it into my Markdown file. With Grammarly to Markdown, I cut the middleman and paste it directly to Markdown.

## SEO META in 1 CLICK

When using frameworks that don’t support SEO out of the box, I often use [SEO META in 1 CLICK](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seo-meta-in-1-click/bjogjfinolnhfhkbipphpdlldadpnmhc) extension. It shows me all important meta information and highlights options that are ok, but also what is missing or could be better. The most valuable feature is the “Headers” tab, where I can see the heading structure of my page. Here’s an example from my home page:

## SEO Minion

[SEO Minion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seo-minion/giihipjfimkajhlcilipnjeohabimjhi) is another extension I use to inspect page SEO. SEO Minion has seven sections, but my favorites are related to links:

- Highlight All Links
- Check Broken Links

Highlight All Links shows all links, but you could filter internal or external, follow or nofollow, or even download a sheet with all links on a page.

Check Broken Links inspects all links on the page and categories them so you can quickly check which links are valid, empty, or redirected.

I find these options essential for improving the site’s SEO health.

## Social Share Preview

Last month I developed [a serverless function that generates OG images](/articles/how-to-create-dynamic-og-images-with-serverless-function-and-sharp/) on my site, and I have used Social Share Preview extension to make it easier to preview my OG image. This extension shows the page preview for Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

## Twitter Links

Twitter Links isn’t available on Chrome Store, but you can [download it from GitHub](https://github.com/round/Twitter-Links-beta). I sometimes use it to check if someone shares my pages on Twitter.

## WakaTime

I am a big fan of [Wakatime](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wakatime/jnbbnacmeggbgdjgaoojpmhdlkkpblgi), and I’ve been using it since 2016 (I discovered that while writing my article [I do HTML and CSS for a living](/articles/i-do-html-and-css-for-a-living/) earlier this year). This software measures how you spend time on your computer. I have it installed in my VS Code and browser. That way, I could understand how much time I spent working, coding, browsing, etc.
