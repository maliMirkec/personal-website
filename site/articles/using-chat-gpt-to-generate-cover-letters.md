Let’s say you are applying for a job and want to write a cover letter that stands out. ChatGPT could help you there, and here is how:

- paste the job description text, including company name and location, into ChatGPT and ask it to write you a cover letter,
- then ask it to make it under 250 words (or any amount you see fit),
- then ask it to make it more optimistic,
- then ask it to use fewer sentences starting with “I.”

{% note %}
The job description has been taken from the following link: [https://jobs.lever.co/close.io/10a1e32b-1a59-48dc-b8f4-e6f0dfae4e20](https://jobs.lever.co/close.io/10a1e32b-1a59-48dc-b8f4-e6f0dfae4e20).
