A while back, I got a sticker from Smashing Magazine saying, “I do CSS/HTML for a living.” It still sits on my MacBook and is pretty accurate - I genuinely do HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for a living.

At the beginning of this year, I got an email from Wakatime with my annual code stats for 2022. According to the Wakatime report, I spent the majority of my coding time on HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Of course, that was no surprise for me. As you can see in the screenshot below, I have underlined all HTML-related languages with pink color, all CSS-related languages with green color, and all JavaScript languages with purple color.

There might be better references than last year, as I was employed full-time by one employer for most of the year. I was responsible for developing and maintaining the website built with Jekyll and Contentful. Hence, I used the Liquid and Markdown languages for HTML templating. Sass was my go-to CSS preprocessor.

I was curious, so I looked back to the year 2021 when I was working for multiple clients. Most of the projects were Jekyll, Hugo, WordPress, and Shopify. Like last year, almost all languages were related to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are a few new languages, like YAML and PHP, which I also used for HTML templating.

My Wakatime stats go all the way to 2016. I spent the majority of my coding time on HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript-related languages. Some of these stats bring back memories of all the projects and technologies I have been working on. From monolith applications for the dairy industry to gigantic WordPress projects to simple static site generator websites - I enjoyed working on almost any of them.

I don’t mind which technology or framework is used as long as I can apply my HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript knowledge. I know my way around many templating languages like Liquid, Pug, or Handlebars and most CSS preprocessors like Sass, Less, and Stylus. But these are just enhancements or extensions to the plain HTML and CSS code. Learning these more sophisticated languages is not hard if you know the basics. Templating language and CSS preprocessors are unimportant if you understand the final output. And that is what matters.

Recently I tried to find a job. I was focused on CSS developer and frontend UI developer roles. I read hundreds and hundreds of job ads and couldn’t see more than a few strictly related to HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

9 out of 10 frontend-related job posts mention React, Vue, Angular, or some of the most popular JavaScript frameworks. I don’t think every web company or agency uses these frameworks. I believe they put it there just in case they ever need to use any JavaScript framework, so they don’t need to hire again.

Fullstack developers are great, and I admire anyone who can do so much in their everyday job. But full-stack developers are rarely specialists in HTML and CSS. For example, I worked in a local startup company of talented backend developers writing HTML alongside their backend code. One week I was running a workshop to teach them the basics of HTML to make them more full-stacky. Not a single person knew what the `<label>` element do. Nobody heard of other input types besides `<input type=” text”>.` I never got to teaching CSS, as they agreed it would be impossible to learn it. So they did their backend job, and the frontend team took care of the HTML and CSS.

So, instead of putting “just-in-case” things in the job description, it would be better to put them into the “nice-to-have” section. Even better, put the correct name of the job role, like HTML or CSS or UI or front-of-the-frontend developer, and hire specialists that could do the best job in their field.

The point of this blog post is that it is possible to make a living working primarily with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. I have been doing that for more than 10 years. I just wish that finding a job with these skills isn’t getting so hard.
