As I was going through my drafts, I stumbled upon this one about my score on The WebAIM Million report from last year. WebAIM conducted an accessibility evaluation of the home pages for the top 1,000,000 websites. [My site is included in the report](https://webaim.org/projects/million/lookup?domain=silvestar.codes) for the first time.

{% cldnrylink "https://webaim.org/projects/million/lookup?domain=silvestar.codes" "the-webaim-million_vy5bua" "A screenshot of results for silvestar.codes from The WebAIM Million website." 759 491 %}

According to this report, my site is in the non-flattering 231,168<sup>th</sup> place in popularity rank and 3,425<sup>th</sup> place in WAVE accessibility rank.

What is more important is that no accessibility error was detected. Yaay!
