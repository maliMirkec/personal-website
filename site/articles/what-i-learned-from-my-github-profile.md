GitHub profile is often recognised as a developer‚Äôs portfolio. It reveals how often do you contribute, and what kind of projects do you like. But what else could we discover from a GitHub profile? Here is what I learned.

_This analysis doesn't include repositories from my clients._

## GitHub profile

!["Contribution activity graph on my GitHub profile."](https://res.cloudinary.com/starbist/image/upload/w_720,q_100/v1571392266/GitHub_profile_Contribution_activity_graph_ridiqj.gif)

Here are some facts from [my Contribution activity graph]:

- I commit a lot.
- I commit often.
- I produced more than 7 commits per day in the last year.
- I produced almost 10 commits per day in 2018.
- I started with remote work in June 2017.
- I had two notable working gaps while struggling to find a gig: first one in autumn of 2017, the second one in spring of 2018.
- I had only one week without a single contribution this year.

## Sourcerer

Sourcerer is an open-source project that gives a visual overview of your GitHub profile.

> ‚ÄúSourcerer is a visual profile for SWEs that analyzes and derives your abilities, preferences, and habits from your commits and source code.‚Äù

Here are some facts from [my Sourcerer profile]:

- I produced more than 3k commits.
- I wrote more than 1,8 million lines of code.
- I wrote more than 1,5 million lines of CSS.
- I wrote more than 90k lines of JS.
- I wrote only 1,7 lines of jQuery.
- I wrote more than 64k lines of HTML.
- I wrote more than 8k lines of PHP.
- I practised Gulp as a tool the most.
- I practised pug as a template engine the most.
- I was most productive during the day.
- I wrote the code during the weekend.
- I favour spaces for indentation.
- I favour the camelcase for variables.

## Conclusions

I came to a few conclusions based on facts from my GitHub profile:

1. **I work too much**. I work on weekends. According to Sourcerer, I am most active on Sundays. üò±
2. **More than 90% of my code is CSS**. I must be a *real* CSS developer. üíØ
3. **Coding is my hobby**. Although this analysis doesn't include my paid engagements, it says how much I like to spend my free time. I spend my free time writing code. ü§î

Although this information is intimidating, I do not think I work too much. I mean, I work much, but I enjoy doing it.

Happy coding, everyone!
