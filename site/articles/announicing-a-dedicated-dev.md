Today I launched [A Dedicated Dev](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/a-dedicated-dev) - a subscription-based web development service. If you need a trustworthy and reliable web developer, you can subscribe and get web development services when you need them.

## How it works

Instead of going through a hiring process for a web developer, all you need to do is subscribe to web development services. Once subscribed, you get a dedicated web developer to make your website the best possible.

Subscriptions are based on 1, 3, and 6 months - a more extended subscription means a lower cost. With a 1-month subscription, you get the option to pause your subscription. The billing cycle lasts 31 days, and if you pause your subscription on day 14, you can use the remaining days in the later billing cycle.

Once subscribed, you can access your Trello board, where you place your requests. No limit exists to how many people you invite to the Trello board or how many requests you submit. Every new request is converted into smaller tasks that are resolved one at a time. It takes a day or two to resolve a task. Remember that A Dedicated Dev is not about speed but about code quality.

Bugs or breaking functionality takes precedence over regular tasks. A Dedicated Dev will eliminate these situations whenever possible.

A Dedicated Dev supports web development on the following platforms: WordPress, HubSpot, Shopify, Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, and Eleventy. If you have a project that uses another platform, contact me, and we can discuss what is possible.

Most meetings, calls, and syncs are eliminated when working with [A Dedicated Dev](https://adedicated.dev/). Asynchronous communication is the key to successful collaboration - no time wasted on unimportant things. So, when making requests, provide as much information as possible, leaving A Dedicated Dev with as few questions as possible.
