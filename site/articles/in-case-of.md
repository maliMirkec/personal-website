Being a freelancer means that I manage my own business. My wife is only familiar with the names of my clients and not much else. This raises concerns about what would happen in the worst-case scenario, such as my death or an accident. How would my clients find out what had happened? Additionally, my wife is unaware of many other aspects of our lives, such as app subscriptions, home surveillance, automation processes, and digital finance.

I have been considering these questions for some time, so I created a document with all the relevant information and shared it with my wife. In this document, I included a list of digital resources I've been using that my wife is unaware of or doesn't have access to.

The most important tool for me is my password manager app. I've been using it for years, and all my login information is stored there. I access it through my email address, which is linked to all the apps and devices I use. I actually have multiple email addresses, but everything is conveniently organized in one place. My wife now has access to it, which allows her to use all the apps.

The following section outlines the devices I have access to. I own an iMac and a MacBook Air, which I use solely. My TV, Chromecast, and Nintendo devices are also set up with my account. Sharing this information is important to ensure that these devices remain in use.

Next is my accountant. My wife has never met her, so I shared her contact information. My accountant is familiar with my clients and knows whom to bill and contact in case of any issues.

I use several finance apps depending on the specific task I want to complete. I rely on different apps for local and global purchases. However, I'm unsure what happens to the money in these apps if they're not accessed for a while, and I want to ensure it doesn't go to waste.

I don't have many subscriptions, and my wife is unaware of them. I would hate for some of these subscriptions to continue even though no one uses them. For instance, I've subscribed to a few TV and music services, email accounts, and chess apps.

I manage several tasks in my house, including home surveillance, automation tasks, and smart devices like robot vacuum cleaners and scales. I listed these items in the document to remind my wife that they are also operational.

I must admit, it felt strange to consider what happens after I'm gone. I feel relieved knowing that I have these lists organized in one place and that my wife can reach for them in case of anything.
