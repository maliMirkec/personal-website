Let me tell you about the most challenging year in my career, the year 2023.

## Professional life

I started the year unemployed. In the first half of 2023 I barely made enough money for living. It was a real challenge, and I wouldn't wish it to anyone.

The global economy crisis was the main reason of this situation. I kept hearing about it from all members of our IT community.

During this period I managed to find a few shorter gigs. Two came from Toptal: one small HubSpot job (which reminded me to publish an article about its [horrible developer experience](/articles/nightmare-dx-hubspot/)) and one WordPress job. The other one was a Shopify job.

I cannot say I enjoyed any of these jobs, but I wasn't in a situation to complain.

The majority of my time was spent on finding a job. I discovered so many sites, so many platforms, so many bullshit job ads that I started to feel that finding a job is impossible.

Since I never give up, I worked on my side projects. I polished my website and tried many new techniques and technologies. I wrote more than 20 articles in the first half of the year. I restarted and rebuilt [my newsletter](http://localhost:8080/side-projects/ui-dev-newsletter/archive/) which has more than 600 subscribers now. I even got a sponsor for it for a short time. I tried to build a subscription service where you rend me as developer for your UI development called [A Dedicated Dev](https://adedicated.dev/), but it never caught up.

Then in July everything changed. I had a few jobs in the same time and I couldn't be happier. First, I worked on an interesting Shopify project. Then, I worked on a [Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) project where I had to learn [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). I was very excited about it because being paid for learning a new technology is something I always preferred. I also worked with Highcharts graphs which I didn't do for years. It was also the first time that I had to design in Figma and being paid for that. I didn't enjoyed that part as much as development, but I cannot say it was a problem either.

Parallel to that, a manager I worked with before contacted me and offer a job as a frontend develop in the marketing team. I immediately accepted the job. They needed help with their site which was built with Next.js and Tailwind. The site was overengineered, and it was not optimized so I proposed to rewrite the website. We choose Contentful and Eleventy and we managed to migrate the whole site within a couple of months. The results were remarkable - the site was so fast and everyone not only liked it, but mentioned how fast it is.

In the last quarter I helped an old client building the new Careers page for a Hugo-based site. I also developed a static part of the Shopify theme for a food industry related website.

I just launced the project without any JS (except GA4).
