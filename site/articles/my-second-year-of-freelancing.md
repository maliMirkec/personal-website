Last year on this day, I wrote the first yearly review of my freelance career. Now it is time to review my second year of freelancing.

<!-- more -->

## Clients

During the last year, I have been working on a dozen projects with eight different clients. Half of the clients came from [the Toptal network], and the other half engaged me via [my website].

Every project was delivered with success and on time. Every client [had positive feedback] for my work and some of them returned to me with new projects. I have been collaborating with clients from Spain, Saudi Arabia, Germany, and the United States.

## Client's Projects

I am really pleased how [my portfolio] looks this year. Every single project was challenging and fulfilling in its own way.

Last year I was building static pages and styleguides for:

- [Calvert],
- International, IT software & services client, and
- Saudi VPS servers and cloud hosting company.

I have been building and maintaining websites that are powered by static page generators like Jekyll and Hugo on:

- [Domino Data Lab],
- [Domino Data Lab Rev],
- Machine Learning Libraries, and
- [Westwing].

I have been working on developing, maintaining, and optimizing WordPress themes for:

- [Trase Yearbook 2018],
- [TheGrio], and
- [Domino Data Lab Pop-up].

I could say that building static sites, pages, and styleguides are the main requirements for my services.

I would even go that far and say that my primary skills are HTML and CSS, just like my favorite sticker says.

## Side projects

I have been working on my own projects, too. I have published [SPRO], a package for creating a perfect Gulp development environment. It is a spin-off for my previous package [Starter Project] with some really cool terminal extensions.

I have published two not-so-successful courses on Skillshare. The first course is [about using SPRO package], and the second course is [about making a website with Hugo] static page generator.

During the last year, I have put a lot of effort into my website. I have rebranded and redesigned the site. I have optimized it to be even more performant, and dev.to community helped a lot. All I had to do is [ask for a little bit of help]. Also, I have migrated my website to a new domain, *silvestar.codes*. I must say that I am thrilled with the final outcome. üòä

Away from the computer, I like to do stuff around my house. My favorite is carpentry.

This year I have built a playhouse for my daughter. It is something that I enjoy doing. Getting away from code and getting my hand dirty from time to time makes me appreciate my everyday job even more.

## Remote working

If you are a remote worker, you should know how challenging it could be. Working from home is full of distractions. When you have a kid, that distractions are multiplied by 100. That is why I rented an office last year. I am working [from my office] for a year now, and I think it was an excellent idea. Separating home and work environment helped me a lot to focus on the job more clearly. Plus, my family and friends respect my work time now that I am not hanging out at home all day long.

> ‚ÄúMost clients respect my schedule as long as we have at least one hour of overlap where we could have a daily standup or a meeting.‚Äù

The other significant advantage when working from the office is that I have a schedule. I am most productive in the morning, so I tend to work in the morning. When negotiating with my clients, I try to communicate this as early as possible. Most clients respect my schedule as long as we have at least one hour of overlap where we could have a daily standup or a meeting.

I got a decent amount of availability requests from my clients directly. That made me start keeping tracks of clients in a simple spreadsheet. I keep track of negotiating status, project type, start date, expected delivery date, and rates, as my prices are not constant for every client and project. That way, I could avoid double-booking myself.

## Problems

Unlike the year before, I had no trouble finding engagements, but I did have a problem with overbooking. For about a month, I was working on multiple projects. It was very exhausting, and I had a difficult time to manage my time. Fortunately, I was able to resolve these issues and meet all deadlines.

> ‚ÄúMy free time and sanity mean too much to me.‚Äù

It was a good lesson for me, and I don't think it would happen again. My free time and sanity mean too much to me. And I don't believe any project, no matter how inviting it could be, could be more important than my family or health.

## Conclusion

I feel like my career is going in the right direction. I could say that I have enjoyed working on each and every project. I was lucky to collaborate with the most incredible professionals. And I look forward to meeting other amazing people on my journey.
