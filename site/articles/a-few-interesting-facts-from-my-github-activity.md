Here are some interesting facts from my GitHub activity according to my [PostSpark GitHub Contributions Chart Generator](https://postspark.app/github-contributions?username=maliMirkec):

- In the first half of last year, [I faced a period of unemployment](/articles/2023-lookback/#the-bad-half), yet my activity graph remained consistently active. I was working on my side projects, site, and blog, which helped me stay sane during the rough period.
- Reflecting on my early days as a freelancer, I blended work with vacations, often chasing the money and deadlines. However, that approach has changed. I now prioritize my time away from code, as evidenced by noticeable gaps in project commits.
- Today, I truly cherish my weekends, dedicating that time to rest and rejuvenation. I'm committed to maintaining this balance in my life.

Coding isn't everythingâ€”taking time off to recharge is equally important. However, I don't stress much if I want to work on something fun over the weekend as long as I enjoy it.

Five years ago, I shared [insights from my GitHub profile](/articles/what-i-learned-from-my-github-profile/), along with some other interesting facts.
