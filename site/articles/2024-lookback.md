This year has been one of my most stable in terms of job security. [After a long search](/articles/2023-lookback/#the-bad-half), I finally secured a long-term project, which I prefer more as I grow older and more mature. However, I still enjoy occasional side projects, so I also worked on several other projects. These side projects are beneficial for both my finances and personal growth.

Regarding technologies, I've worked with Eleventy and Shopify the most this year. The common denominator for both is the Liquid template engine. I mastered it to the detail, and I enjoy working with it.

Although I don't rely on AI too much, it did help me publish two VS Code extensions ([Clamp it!](/articles/clamp-it/) and [OKLChanger](/articles/oklchanger/)) and upgrade my existing Chrome extension ([Code Line Daily](/articles/code-line-daily-extension-is-live-again/)).

Once again, I redesigned my site. I did it this December and documented my progress in the [Advent of redesign](/side-projects/redesign/).

After a year of pause from writing on publications, I returned with two articles for [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/author/silvestarbistrovic/) and one for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/04/infinite-scrolling-logos-html-css/).

One other great thing happened this year - the BlueSky social network. It is so great to have a feed full of web dev, CSS, accessibility, and other related topics. In fact, it made me restart my [UI Dev Newsletter](http://localhost:8080/side-projects/ui-dev-newsletter/). I hope it stays like this as long as possible. Here's my BlueSky profile: <https://bsky.app/profile/silvestar.codes>.

There's nothing new on a personal level besides a lot of new gray hair. Someone told me it is “in” to have white hair. I choose to believe that's true.
