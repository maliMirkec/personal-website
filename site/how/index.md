This website is built using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) static page generator and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) is used to speed up and protect this website. It's featured on [JAMStack as an example](https://jamstack.org/examples/). I've set up project architecture and implemented coding standards. The layout is built using [CSS Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid-layout/) and [Flexbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/). [BEM](http://getbem.com/) is used as a naming convention. [CSS Animations](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/) are used to animate cta. [Modular scale](https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass) and [fluid typography](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography/) are implemented for a more slicker reading experience.

The development workflow is completely automated using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). The website looks good on every modern browser, both desktop, and mobile. If you find a bug, please [report an issue](https://github.com/maliMirkec/hexo-sb/issues/new) on GitHub. And yes, this website is [available publicly](https://github.com/maliMirkec/hexo-sb) but please be kind of intellectual ownership. The branching model is inherited from [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) is used as documentation method.

I've built logo using [SVG](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) to add the more crisp look to the site. Template engine [ejs](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) is used to built HTML files. [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) is used to host images and [srcset](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/) is used to add responsive images.

The website is super fast. Check the scores on [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsilvestar.codes) and [Testmysite.io](https://testmysite.io/59832155a700c43c98b08b12/www.silvestar.codes). Perfect! This is achieved by optimizing every asset. The most crucial optimization is [Critical CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/understanding-critical-css/) implemented here as well.

Articles about [CSS tabs](http://css-weekly.com/issue-237/), [CSS sidebar toggle](http://css-weekly.com/issue-258/), [Using CSS Grid where appropriate](http://css-weekly.com/issue-277/), [writing styleguides](https://css-weekly.com/issue-361/) and [making CSS ribbons](https://css-weekly.com/issue-362/) are featured in [CSS Weekly newsletter](http://css-weekly.com/) curated by [Zoran Jambor](https://twitter.com/ZoranJambor).
