## What I don’t do?

This is the list of the things I don’t do because *I don’t know how to*.

I don’t do:
- full-stack development
- JavaScript framework development
  - React development
  - Vue development
  - Angular development
- Next.js, Nuxt, or Gatsby development
- backend development of any kind, including
  - web application development
  - WordPress backend development
  - Shopify backend development
  - eCommerce development
- mobile development
  - Android development
  - iOs development
- blockchain development
- in-depth SEO improvements
- …

The list goes on, but you could figure out that I am not proficient in any backend or JavaScript framework development.

Thank you for not wasting my time.
