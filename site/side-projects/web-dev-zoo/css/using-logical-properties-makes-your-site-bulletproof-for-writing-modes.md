CSS chamois says:

> Using logical properties makes your site bulletproof for writing modes.

And here’s why:

{% note "Benefits" %}
- Logical properties simplify the maintenance of multilingual websites by enabling a single set of rules.
- Logical properties also improve accessibility for users with diverse reading preferences.
  Components using logical properties can be placed anywhere in a layout, regardless of writing mode.
- They work well with CSS Grid and Flexbox, creating flexible design systems.
