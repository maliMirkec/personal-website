CSS Coati says:

> Use `display: contents` with great caution.

And hereâ€™s why:

{% note "Side effects" %}
- It removes elements from the accessibility tree, making them invisible to screen readers and harming usability.
- Some interactive elements (like buttons or links) may stop working as expected because their structure is altered.
- Child elements lose inheritance from their parent (like flex, grid, or positioning), which can lead to layout issues.
- Some scripts or CSS selectors relying on parent-child relationships might break because the parent element is removed visually.
- Applying different CSS methods, like flex or grid, can often handle cases better than `display: contents`.
