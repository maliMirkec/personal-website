Accessibility agouti says:

> Always write meaningful `alt` attributes for images.

And here’s why:

{% note "Benefits" %}
- Screen readers read `alt` text so blind people know what the image shows.
- Good `alt` text helps everyone get the message behind an image.
- If an image is missing, the `alt` text tells users what should be there.
- Search engines use `alt` text to understand images and rank pages higher.
- Many laws require websites to have useful `alt` text for accessibility.
{% endnote %}

Here are some tips on how to write good `alt` attributes.

{% note "Tips" %}
- Leave out ‘Image of’ or ‘Picture of’.
- Use clear and simple words.
- Describe the image in a useful way.
- Write naturally, not just for search engines.
- If an image is for design only, leave the `alt` text empty so screen readers skip it.
