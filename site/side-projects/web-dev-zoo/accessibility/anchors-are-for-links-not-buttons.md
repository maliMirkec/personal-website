Accessibility Aurochs says:

> Anchors are for links, not buttons.

And here’s why:

{% note "Benefits" %}
- Links direct users to other pages or websites, while buttons perform actions on the current page.  
- Screen readers help distinguish between links and buttons for those with visual impairments.  
- Links are activated with the Enter key, while buttons can be activated with both the Enter and Space keys.  
- Search engines follow links to find more pages, boosting your website's visibility.  
- Links allow users to open pages in new tabs, bookmark them, or copy URLs, and buttons don't.  
{% endnote %}
