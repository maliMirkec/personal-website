Accessibility aardwolf says:

> Sometimes font weight might affect the color contrast score.

And here’s why:

{% note "Side effects" %}
- Thin fonts can be stylish but are harder to read, especially on bright backgrounds.
- If you must use a light font, ensure the text color is darker to maintain readability.
- Avoid using thin weights for small-sized text because they might be unreadable.
- Use heavier font weights to improve visibility for key information, like buttons and headings.
- Some screens or devices render fonts differently, so check contrast on various devices.
