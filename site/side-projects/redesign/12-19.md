Today is dedicated to improving my website's search engine optimization (SEO). I focused on identifying and fixing several broken links, ensuring visitors could navigate smoothly without encountering errors.

Additionally, I set up a few redirects to guide users to the correct pages more effectively. As a result of these efforts, my SEO score has risen from 88 to 90â€”a promising improvement! I plan to continue enhancing my SEO strategy at a later time.
