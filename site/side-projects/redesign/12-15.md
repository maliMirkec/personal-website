I updated all blog posts with a new design, and now they look soooo much nicer.

I also added the social links in the footer section.

And I wrote a short blog post on how to [transition between pages smoothly with a few lines of CSS code](/articles/transition-between-pages-smoothly-with-a-single-line-of-code-2024/).
