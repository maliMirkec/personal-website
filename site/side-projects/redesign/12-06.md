Today, I've moved [tags](/tags/) pages to a new template.

It doesn't seem like a big deal, but it kinda is â€” all pages, except for the side projects, have been moved to a new template.

I plan to move the rest of the pages this weekend and then start developing the blog post template.

I've been looking forward to that for a long time.
