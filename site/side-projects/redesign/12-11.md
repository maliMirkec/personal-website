Today, I cleaned some more unused metadata from blog posts. I removed the old social images because I'm generating my social images automatically these days.

Also, I've finally added my articles from Smashing Magazine and Frontend Masters:

- [Building a live preview with Eleventy and Contentful](/articles/building-a-live-preview-with-eleventy-contentful-and-liquid-templating/)
- [Drawing a line to connect elements with CSS anchor position](/articles/drawing-a-line-to-connect-elements-with-css-anchor-positioning/)
- [Infinite-Scrolling Logos In Flat HTML And Pure CSS](/articles/infinite-scrolling-logos-in-flat-html-and-pure-css/)
