description: I started redesigning my site a while ago but never finished it, so I thought it would be a good idea to finish it this Advent. This is day 23.

My site runs on Eleventy 3 as of today!

The migration went pretty smoothly.

I found some invalid Liquid code, so I fixed that, too.

I've updated the template for my legacy side projects [Ribbons](/side-projects/ribbons/) and [Starter Project](/side-projects/starter-project/), and fixed the broken [Dev Cards 360](/side-projects/dev-cards-360/) project.
