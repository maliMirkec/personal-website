I wasn't in the mood for writing yesterday, but I made some progress:

- added secondary navigation (still thinking of moving it to the end of the page),
- added a subtle background pattern in the form of my logo,
- updated [my favorites page](/favorites/) and [my favorite concerts](/favorites/concerts/) page,
- reordered components on some pages to stack better on smaller viewports, and
- switched to [media query range syntax](https://cssence.com/2024/superior-range-syntax/).

I'm still in no mood for writing, but happy with the progress.
