Today, I've moved more pages to the new template:

- [Links](/links/),
- [What I don't do](/no-skills/),
- [What I don't allow](/no-ads/),
- [My favorite TV shows](/favorites/tv/), and
- [My favorite music](/favorites/music/).

For the last two, I had to reuse the old code to make [the accessible gallery](/articles/how-to-build-an-expandable-accessible-gallery/) work.

Btw, I need to refresh these lists, since I have discovered many great new music and shows since the last time I updated them.

I've also updated the secondary nav and reorganized it. It makes more sense to me now.

In my previous efforts to improve my SEO score, I've updated the meta descriptions of every page on the site. I left the previous ones as a reference. Now that I haven't used them for ages, they're gone, and my files are much cleaner and lighter.

I'm close to migrating all of the pages to the new template. Once the first phase of the migration is over, I look forward to making more small styling updates.
