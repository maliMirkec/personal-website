I've started to redesign my site a while ago and never finished it, so I thought it would be a good idea to finish it this advent.

The design is based on rounded elements and gradients. It might change as I progress. It might be broken. It might work out. I don't know, we'll see.

I'm doing it out on the open so you can browse the site, starting with the [new homepage](/), and check what I have so far. The update is quite significant so you'll know that you are on the redesigned page. For example, this blog post template is not yet redesigned.

If you want, you can [leave any feedback on this site](/contact/), or on social networks like [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/silvestar.codes) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@cita).

Here's the list of some things I plan to do this month:

- upgrade to the new Eleventy version,
- [keep the perfect Lighthouse score](/articles/13th-place-on-eleventy-leaderboards/),
- experiment with the new CSS features,
- clean up and update the content on some pages,
- update [my setup page](/uses/),
- etc.

Stay tuned and good luck to me!
