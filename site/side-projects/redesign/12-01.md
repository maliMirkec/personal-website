I started redesigning my site a while ago but never finished it, so I thought it would be a good idea to finish it this Advent.

The design is based on rounded elements and gradients. It might change as I progress, be broken, or work out. I don't know; we'll see.

I'm doing it on the open so you can browse the site, starting with the [new homepage](/), and check what I have. The update is significant, so you'll know you are on the redesigned page. For example, this blog post template has not yet been redesigned.

You can leave [leave any feedback on this site](/contact/) or on social networks like [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/silvestar.codes) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@cita).

Here's the list of some things I plan to do this month:

- upgrade to the new Eleventy version,
- [keep the perfect Lighthouse score](/articles/13th-place-on-eleventy-leaderboards/),
- experiment with the new CSS features,
- clean up and update the content on some pages,
- update [my setup page](/uses/),
- etc.

Stay tuned, and good luck to me!
