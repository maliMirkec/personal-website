description: I started redesigning my site a while ago but never finished it, so I thought it would be a good idea to finish it this Advent. This is day 2.

On day 2, I've updated many pages, including:

- [blog](/articles/)
- [publications](/publications/),
- [side projects](/side-projects/), and
- [slides](/slides/).

I've realized I never put my articles from Frontend Masters to the publications article list. I'll definitely add them this month.

I also updated the banner component. Now, I use the modifier `sticky` for all banners that should be sticky on the page.

The homepage has a new banner style, the blue one, which announces my upcoming redesign project.

Good progress overall.
