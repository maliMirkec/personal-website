You might notice that this blog post has a completely new look. That is because I started working on the design of the blog post template.

Only [posts in the Advent of redesign](/side-projects/redesign/) category and [Building a live preview with Eleventy and Contentful blog post](/articles/building-a-live-preview-with-eleventy-contentful-and-liquid-templating/) have been updated for now.

I really look forward to adding more features to this template, like social sharing buttons and “read more” links.
