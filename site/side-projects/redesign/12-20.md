If you [go to the homepage](/), you might notice a new animated SVG in the hero section.

I'm pleased with the design but am considering adding one or two "slides" to better emphasize the message it should convey.

For users who prefer reduced motion, the animation won't play.

Here's the CodePen:

{% codepen "CiTA" "xbKdVvz" "dark" "html,result" "550" false false true %}
