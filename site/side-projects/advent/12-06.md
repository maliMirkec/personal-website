A horizontal rule is usually used as a visual divider between two textual elements.

The example component is visible below.

---

{% raw %}
<hr class="advent-rule">
<style>
.copy hr.advent-rule {
  all: unset;
  display: block;
  margin-block-start: 1.25em;
  text-align: center;
  grid-column: 3;
}
.copy hr.advent-rule:before {
  all: unset;
  content: "〰️〰️〰️";
}
</style>
{% endraw %}

---

A few notes about this horizontal rule component:

- the default horizontal rule style is reset using the `all: unset` declaration,
- the content is set using the before pseudo-selector.

---

The code:

```html
<hr class="advent-rule">
```

```css
.advent-rule {
  all: unset;

  display: block;

  margin-top: 3em;
  margin-bottom: 3em;

  text-align: center;
}

.advent-rule:before {
  content: "〰️〰️〰️";
}
```
