sections:
  - type: hero
    code: "position-items: center"
    desc: >-
      This declaration would position all grid items in the center, including items in the last row.


      I'm aware it would be tricky to implement this, especially with some combination of numbers of items, but still, it would be nice to have.


      In the example below, I've added a border to these items.
