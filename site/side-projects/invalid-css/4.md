      This declaration would position all grid items in the center, including items in the last row.


      I'm aware it would be tricky to implement this, especially with some combination of numbers of items, but still, it would be nice to have.


      In the example below, I've added a border to these items.
    tag:
      href: /side-projects/invalid-css/
      title: Invalid CSS
    notags: true
    pen: oNdWpZW

    title: See other not-so-valid CSS things
  - type: cards-alpha
    cta:
      title: Check the component
    filter: myCSS
    sorter: date
    exclude: true
  - type: banner-beta
    banner: newsletter
