```css
min-aspect-ratio: 1
```

The `min-aspect-ratio: 1` declaration makes sure the component's aspect ratio is never less than the defined value. While the component can be wider or taller, its ratio won't fall below the specified minimum.

In certain situations, using `min-aspect-ratio` may be a better choice than `min-block-size`.
