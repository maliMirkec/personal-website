questions:
  text: This week’s newsletter includes a quick quiz for you. Test your knowledge with questions based on the links provided. You can find the answers at the end of the issue.
  list:
    - question: How does using the dialog element improve accessibility for modals?
      short: It provides built-in accessibility features.
      long: The dialog element automatically handles focus management and keyboard interactions for modal windows, improving accessibility without needing extra JavaScript.
    - question: What’s the workaround for using light-dark() with gradients?
      short: Use light-dark() inside the linear-gradient().
      long: Since light-dark() only accepts <color> values and not gradients, you need to place the result of light-dark() inside a linear-gradient(). This means using light-dark(red, orange) for one part of the gradient and light-dark(blue, purple) for the other.
    - question: "Which CSS property makes a masonry layout denser by filling gaps?"
      short: "grid-auto-flow: dense"
      long: "The 'grid-auto-flow: dense' property helps make a masonry layout more compact by filling in gaps where smaller items can be placed within the grid, reducing empty space."
    - question: Which HTML element was used to optimize image rendering in this project?
      short: canvas
      long: The canvas element was used to batch render images and optimize the performance of displaying a large number of images efficiently. By rendering images offscreen, it reduced memory consumption.
    - question: What CDN feature can hide backend performance issues related to LCP?
      short: Caching.
      long: CDN caching can sometimes hide backend performance issues, including those that affect LCP (Largest Contentful Paint). This can make it difficult to identify and address underlying server-side problems that may delay page load times.
