## Frontend

Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of working on a wide range of web development projects, including static site generators, WordPress websites, and page speed optimizations. Through these experiences, I've honed my skills and become highly proficient in a variety of web technologies. Ultimately, though, my greatest strengths lie in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - the foundational building blocks of any successful website. So if you're looking for a frontend developer with deep expertise in these areas, look no further!

## Static Site Generators

With a keen eye on the ever-evolving tech landscape, I recognized the growing trend for static sites several years ago. So, starting in 2017, I began working with static site generators like **Jekyll**, **Hugo**, **Hexo**, and **11ty**, building a portfolio of impressive static sites, including [Westwing](/portfolio/westwing/), [Domino Data Lab](/portfolio/dominodatalab/), and [Wunder Mobility](/portfolio/wundermobility/).

## WordPress

WordPress is undoubtedly a go-to choice for many businesses as the top framework for building websites. However, I firmly believe that custom themes are always a better option than pre-made themes. I have considerable experience building custom themes from scratch and have successfully developed themes for [Credit Card Insider](/portfolio/creditcardinsider/), [Irina & Matej](/portfolio/irinaandmatej/), and [Trase Yearbook 2018](/portfolio/yearbook-trase/).

## Page speed optimizations

Did you know that a slow website can hurt your business? Google now penalizes sites with suboptimal performance, so it's more important than ever to have a fast, well-optimized website. As a web development professional, I have extensive experience optimizing PageSpeed scores and implementing the latest best practices, including Core Web Vitals. Let me help ensure your website is performing at its best.
