## Static Site Generators

There has been a global trend for static sites in recent few years. I have been lucky to recognize that trend and started to learn more about it back in 2017. I have build more than a few static site using **Jekyll**, **Hugo**, **Hexo**, and **11ty**, like [Westwing](/portfolio/westwing/), [Domino Data Lab](/portfolio/dominodatalab/), and [Han Han Xue](/portfolio/hanhanxue/).

## WordPress

WordPress is still number one framework for building sites in the world. Buying a theme for WordPress is easy, but I always recommend developing a **new theme** from scratch. I have build several custom themes, like the ones for [Credit Card Insider](/portfolio/creditcardinsider/), [Irina & Matej](/portfolio/irinaandmatej/), and [Trase Yearbook 2018](/portfolio/yearbook-trase/).

## PageSpeed Optimizations

Did you know that Google penalizes sites which are not very performant? For that reason, it is important have a fast site that follow the latest best practices, like Core Web Vitals. I have been optimizing PageSpeed score for several sites, including my own.

## Writing

In 2016, I started to blog about my work. Since then, my writing skills improved greatly and I have been publishing articles for publications like **[Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/silvestar-bistrovic//)**, **[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/silvestar/)**, **[LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/silvestarbistrovic/)**, and **[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/resume/silvestar-bistrovic#Experience)**.
