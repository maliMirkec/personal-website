## Frontend

Over the past decade, I have worked on a variety of web development projects, including static site generators, WordPress websites, and optimizations for page speed. Through these experiences, I have honed my skills and become proficient in various web technologies. My greatest strengths, however, lie in HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”the foundational building blocks of any successful website. If you're looking for a frontend developer with deep expertise in these areas, you can count on me!

## Static Site Generators

Noticing the rapidly changing tech landscape, I identified the rising trend of static sites several years ago. Beginning in 2017, I started working with static site generators such as Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, and 11ty. Through this experience, I built a portfolio of impressive static sites, including [Westwing](/portfolio/westwing/), [Domino Data Lab](/portfolio/dominodatalab/), [Wunder Mobility](/portfolio/wundermobility/), and [Heyflow](/portfolio/heyflow/).

## Shopify

Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms, known for its flexibility, especially among non-developers. However, developers are often called in to assist when projects become more complex. I have worked on several Shopify projects, including [Little Bundle](/portfolio/little-bundle/) and [Spartan Precision Equipment](/portfolio/javelin-bipod/), where I helped clients optimize their stores and develop new features.

## WordPress

WordPress is a popular choice for businesses looking to build websites, and custom themes are often a better option than pre-made ones. I have significant experience creating custom themes from scratch, having successfully developed themes for [Credit Card Insider](/portfolio/creditcardinsider/), [Irina & Matej](/portfolio/irinaandmatej/), and [Trase Yearbook 2018](/portfolio/yearbook-trase/).

## Page speed optimizations

Did you know that a slow website can negatively impact your business? Google penalizes sites with poor performance, making it more crucial than ever to have a fast and well-optimized website. As a web development professional, I have extensive experience optimizing PageSpeed scores and implementing the latest best practices, including Core Web Vitals. Let me help ensure your website performs at its best.
