## Frontend

Over the past decade, I've worked on a wide range of web development projects, including static site generators, WordPress websites, and page speed optimizations. Through these experiences, I've honed my skills and become proficient in various web technologies. But ultimately, my greatest strengths lie in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - the foundational building blocks of any successful website. So if you're looking for a frontend developer with deep expertise in these areas, look no further!

## Static Site Generators

With a keen eye on the ever-evolving tech landscape, I recognized the growing trend for static sites several years ago. So, starting in 2017, I began working with static site generators like **Jekyll**, **Hugo**, **Hexo**, and **11ty**, building a portfolio of impressive static sites, including [Westwing](/portfolio/westwing/), [Domino Data Lab](/portfolio/dominodatalab/), [Wunder Mobility](/portfolio/wundermobility/), and [Heyflow](/portfolio/heyflow/).

## WordPress

WordPress is undoubtedly a go-to choice for many businesses as the top framework for building websites. However, custom themes are always a better option than pre-made themes. I have considerable experience building custom themes from scratch and have successfully developed themes for [Credit Card Insider](/portfolio/creditcardinsider/), [Irina & Matej](/portfolio/irinaandmatej/), and [Trase Yearbook 2018](/portfolio/yearbook-trase/).

## Shopify

Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms. Although many non-developers like to use Shopify for its flexibility, when things start to get heavy, developers are the ones called to the rescue. I have been working on several Shopify projects, including [Little Bundle](/portfolio/little-bundle/) and [Spartan Precision Equipment](/portfolio/javelin-bipod/), where I helped clients optimize and develop features.

## Page speed optimizations

Did you know that a slow website can hurt your business? Google now penalizes sites with suboptimal performance, so it's more important than ever to have a fast, well-optimized website. As a web development professional, I have extensive experience optimizing PageSpeed scores and implementing the latest best practices, including Core Web Vitals. Let me help ensure your website is performing at its best.
