> Silvestar is a talented, dedicated, and knowledgeable web developer – I really enjoy having him on my team! He is a highly motivated professional and a terrific team player with solid technical skills.
>
> He not only helped us to overcome several technical issues on our old setup but also fully migrated our website to a new CMS. Further together with the Creative team he completely redesigned the website by implementing our new company branding.
>
> Silvestar gets ahead of issues before they happen so that work is executed smoothly. In addition, he is always proactively thinking outside of the box on ways to further improve business operations by finding ways to automate processes with his exceptional engineering and coding skills. This was especially helpful in regard to our lead gen activities.
>
> I look forward to more opportunities to work with Silvestar and recommend him for technical or web dev projects – particularly those that require careful planning.
