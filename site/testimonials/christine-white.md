> I worked with Silvestar for 8 months during his engagement with Domino. Silvestar is diligent, focused, quick, and always willing to go the extra mile to make a recommendation for how to do something better. I knew we could rely on Silvestar for anything, and was impressed at how quick he learned the HubSpot CMS to support us during a migration. For that I would highly recommend Silvestar.
