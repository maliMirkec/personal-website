> _I worked with Silvestar for when I first started at Domino Data Lab, he was INSTRUMENTAL in some of my first big wins as Head of Partner Marketing, including launching the Domino Partner Network - a massive milestone for us!_
>
> _Silvestar is detail-oriented, extremely responsive, and VERY CREATIVE with bringing solutions to work around dependencies and constraints. I have no doubts that Silvestar will be a KEY RESOURCE for any organization he joins!_
