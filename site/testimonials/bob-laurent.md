> Silvestar is a highly talented web developer that I was fortunate enough to work with during our time together at Domino. Whenever we'd come up with an idea to make our website better, he was able to bring our idea to life in record time. But more importantly, he didn't just do what we asked – he also made great recommendations that improved the overall usability of our site. He's constantly looking for ways to improve his skills so he stays at the top of his game, and it shows in the variety of work he was able to do for us. Any company that's fortunate enough to work with him will get a highly professional and skilled web/UI developer that's also a true pleasure to work with.
