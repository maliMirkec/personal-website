excerpt: Clearly been the most seamless and enriching developer-designer-collaboration I've had so far...

> I've been working closely with Silvestar for about 2 years now, managing and designing the website project that he's in charge of developing. It has clearly been the most seamless and enriching developer-designer-collaboration I've had so far.
>
> His work transformed our website from a poorly built, difficult-to-maintain draft into a high-performance, scalable site that will serve us well for years to come. Silvestar has worked with us on finding the best possible software and code solutions for each part of the website's infrastructure, and has implemented them all himself, incl. the complete CMS setup in a highly editor-friendly way.
> Since then, I've had the pleasure to bring over 40 new pages to life with his help.
>
> What I like particularly is Silvestar's eagerness to find straightforward solutions for our needs with the lowest amount of code necessary, rather than relying on third party tools that would just clutter things up and lead to bad performance.
> That being said, he even optimized some of our landing pages to achieve a perfect 100% score across all PageSpeed Insights categories – something I’ve never seen before. It's all thanks to his constant hard work of iterating on all ends of the code until perfection.
>
> I highly recommend Silvestar to any marketing team in need of a skilled, diligent freelancer who delivers robust and scalable web solutions. I've learned so much from our collaboration and I'm looking forward to continuing it.
