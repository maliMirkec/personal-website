> I've worked with Silvestar on various projects, mainly in the Ecommerce realm. He's easily one of the best developers I've had the chance to work with. Silvestar can think like a designer and solve problems rationally and allocate deliverables neatly and in-scope. He's also great with clients, organised and transparent. These are fine qualities in a developer. I strongly recommend.
