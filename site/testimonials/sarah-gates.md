> _I worked with Silvestar during the last six months of his engagement at Domino. He was very quick to respond to requests, dependable, and communicated well. He took on learning HubSpot CMS to support us through migration and quickly jumped in to resolve issues as they arose. He was a valuable part of the marketing organization._
