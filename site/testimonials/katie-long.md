> It has been a pleasure working with Silvestar on various web development projects. He is not only technically skilled at his job, I am also continuously impressed with how proactive he approaches his work. In addition to finding and responding to issues, he is always looking for ways to optimise and make changes on his own. On top of his skillset, he is excellent at explaining what he is doing in a straightforward way, is always ready to help when needed and easy to work with. I can strongly recommend working with him!
