<div class="wrapper margin-top-alpha margin-bottom-alpha">
  <div class="padding">
    <div class="copy copy--body"><p>Last year on this day, I wrote the first yearly review of my freelance career. Now it is time to review my second year of freelancing.</p>
<h2>Clients</h2>
<p>During the last year, I have been working on a dozen projects with eight different clients. Half of the clients came from <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/silvestar-bistrovic#trust-nothing-but-brilliant-freelancers">the Toptal network</a>, and the other half engaged me via <a href="https://www.silvestar.codes">my website</a>.</p>
<p>Every project was delivered with success and on time. Every client <a href="/#Testimonials">had positive feedback</a> for my work and some of them returned to me with new projects. I have been collaborating with clients from Spain, Saudi Arabia, Germany, and the United States.</p>
<h2>Client's Projects</h2>
<p>I am really pleased how <a href="/portfolio/">my portfolio</a> looks this year. Every single project was challenging and fulfilling in its own way.</p>
<p>Last year I was building static pages and styleguides for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/portfolio/calvert/">Calvert</a>,</li>
<li>International, IT software &amp; services client, and</li>
<li>Saudi VPS servers and cloud hosting company.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been building and maintaining websites that are powered by static page generators like Jekyll and Hugo on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/portfolio/dominodatalab/">Domino Data Lab</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/portfolio/dominodatalab-rev/">Domino Data Lab Rev</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/portfolio/machine-learning-libraries/">Machine Learning Libraries</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="/portfolio/westwing/">Westwing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been working on developing, maintaining, and optimizing WordPress themes for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/portfolio/yearbook-trase/">Trase Yearbook 2018</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/portfolio/thegrio/">TheGrio</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="/portfolio/dominodatalab-pop-up/">Domino Data Lab Pop-up</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could say that building static sites, pages, and styleguides are the main requirements for my services.</p>
<img class="cld-responsive" data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/starbist/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_auto,c_scale/i_do_css_html_for_a_living2_n3llxk" alt="I do CSS and HTML for a living sticker." sizes="800px" loading="lazy">
<p>I would even go that far and say that my primary skills are HTML and CSS, just like my favorite sticker says.</p>
<h2>Side projects</h2>
<p>I have been working on my own projects, too. I have published <a href="https://starter.silvestar.codes/">SPRO</a>, a package for creating a perfect Gulp development environment. It is a spin-off for my previous package <a href="https://starter.silvestar.codes/starter-project/">Starter Project</a> with some really cool terminal extensions.</p>
<p>I have published two not-so-successful courses on Skillshare. The first course is <a href="https://skl.sh/2EcUlRt">about using SPRO package</a>, and the second course is <a href="https://skl.sh/2ILioJ8">about making a website with Hugo</a> static page generator.</p>
<p>During the last year, I have put a lot of effort into my website. I have rebranded and redesigned the site. I have optimized it to be even more performant, and dev.to community helped a lot. All I had to do is <a href="https://dev.to/starbist/lets-make-my-website-even-better-37a5">ask for a little bit of help</a>. Also, I have migrated my website to a new domain, <em>silvestar.codes</em>. I must say that I am thrilled with the final outcome. 😊</p>
<p>Away from the computer, I like to do stuff around my house. My favorite is carpentry.</p>
<img class="cld-responsive" data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/starbist/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_auto,c_scale/gazebo_rqxkif" alt="Playhouse in my backyard." sizes="800px" loading="lazy">
<p>This year I have built a playhouse for my daughter. It is something that I enjoy doing. Getting away from code and getting my hand dirty from time to time makes me appreciate my everyday job even more.</p>
<h2>Remote working</h2>
<p>If you are a remote worker, you should know how challenging it could be. Working from home is full of distractions. When you have a kid, that distractions are multiplied by 100. That is why I rented an office last year. I am working <a href="/uses/">from my office</a> for a year now, and I think it was an excellent idea. Separating home and work environment helped me a lot to focus on the job more clearly. Plus, my family and friends respect my work time now that I am not hanging out at home all day long.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Most clients respect my schedule as long as we have at least one hour of overlap where we could have a daily standup or a meeting.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other significant advantage when working from the office is that I have a schedule. I am most productive in the morning, so I tend to work in the morning. When negotiating with my clients, I try to communicate this as early as possible. Most clients respect my schedule as long as we have at least one hour of overlap where we could have a daily standup or a meeting.</p>
<p>I got a decent amount of availability requests from my clients directly. That made me start keeping tracks of clients in a simple spreadsheet. I keep track of negotiating status, project type, start date, expected delivery date, and rates, as my prices are not constant for every client and project. That way, I could avoid double-booking myself.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>Unlike the year before, I had no trouble finding engagements, but I did have a problem with overbooking. For about a month, I was working on multiple projects. It was very exhausting, and I had a difficult time to manage my time. Fortunately, I was able to resolve these issues and meet all deadlines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My free time and sanity mean too much to me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a good lesson for me, and I don't think it would happen again. My free time and sanity mean too much to me. And I don't believe any project, no matter how inviting it could be, could be more important than my family or health.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I feel like my career is going in the right direction. I could say that I have enjoyed working on each and every project. I was lucky to collaborate with the most incredible professionals. And I look forward to meeting other amazing people on my journey.</p>
