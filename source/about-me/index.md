I am Silvestar Bistrović, fearless web developer, CSS craftsman, [JAMstack](//jamstack.org/) enthusiast, and WordPress theme specialist.

I enjoy creating pixel-perfect, responsive, and modern websites. My focus is on delivering the best experience for users on every device. Making faster, lighter, and more secure sites using WordPress or Static Page Generators is my specialty.

When I am not coding, I like to write new articles on my blog.

I am working as a freelance web developer, and I am working remotely from my office in Osijek, Croatia.
